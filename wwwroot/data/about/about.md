        Hello, My name is <strong>Kevin Salimi</strong>. I'm a Back End .NET developer at
        <a href="https://techspire.nl/" target="_blank">Techspire Co</a> (Haarlem, Netherlands).
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of my work at Techspire, I consume many blog posts, podcasts, and videos to learn about the new technologies
        available to me. Iâ€™m very focused on new .NET products from Microsoft; blogging about that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing knowledge and contributing to open source projects are my passion and a better part of my leisure time.
