        Hello, My name is <strong>Kaywan Salimi</strong>. I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.rabobank.com/" target="_blank">Rabobank Co</a> (Utrecht, Netherlands).
    </p>
    <p>
        In Rabobank, I work primarily with .NET Core and Azure Cloud to help produce a fantastic product with a bunch of nice people from all over the world, a system for evaluating the risks of mortgages for the bank. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of my work at Rabobank, I consume many blog posts, podcasts, and videos to learn about the new technologies
        available to me. Iâ€™m very focused on new .NET and Azure products; blogging about that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing knowledge and contributing to open source projects are my passion and a better part of my leisure time.
