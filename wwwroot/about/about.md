        Hello, My name is Kevin. I'm a .NET developer working at
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/asa-inc-/" target="_blank">Asa Co</a> (Tehran, Iran).
        I work primarily with ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core to help produce amazing stock market products for the
        <a href="http://agahgroup.com/" target="_blank">Agah group.</a>
        In addition, multi-threading and memory management are regular challenges here that makes me thrilled after solving them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of my work at Asa, I consume many blog posts, podcasts, and videos to learn about the new technologies
        available to me. I’m very focused on new .NET products from Microsoft; blogging about that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sharing knowledge and contributing to open source projects are my passion and a better part of my leisure time.
